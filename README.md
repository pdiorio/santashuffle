# Santa Shuffle

A Go project to create and notify Secret Santa assignments. 

Santa Shuffle helps you generate matches for Secret Santa participants. 
It allows you to specify participants, their email address for notification, and also other participants they should never be matched with as a gift-giver (e.g. spouses, enemies, etc).
